# Streamlabs.SocketClient

Unofficial C# client library for the Streamlabs socket API. Allows you to receive events from Streamlabs in real-time.

## Installation

This library is not ready for general use yet. Alpha releases are available on NuGet, but the API should not be considered stable until version 1.0.0.

```bash
dotnet add package Streamlabs.SocketClient --prerelease
```

## Usage

Step-by-step instructions will be added here once the API is stable. For now you can use the
[Event Capture](https://github.com/meenzen/Streamlabs.SocketClient/tree/main/src/Streamlabs.EventCapture) project
as a reference.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep
commit messages consistent.

When reporting bugs, please include the raw JSON payload of the event that caused the issue. You can find it attached to
the error message or by enabling debug logging and looking for `Streamlabs: Event received - [json]`.
Alternatively, you can use the [Event Capture](https://github.com/meenzen/Streamlabs.SocketClient/tree/main/src/Streamlabs.EventCapture)
tool to capture events and save them to a file.
